# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this challenge was to create an interactive webpage that presents UFO sighting data.

I used JAvaScript to display and filterable the data by date, locations and shapes.

## Summary

Even though this webpage is well apealing and farely interactive, there a few modification that could be made to make it more user friendly.
* The filters are specific and mistyping want we want to filter will end up in a error.

If possible, I would like to add a pulldown list for shape filter, autocorrecting the format for the date, and suggestion pane for the city, state and country.

This will allow the users to use the webpage with less stress.
