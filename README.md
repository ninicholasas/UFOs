# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this challenge was to create an interactive webpage that presents UFO sighting data.

I used JAvaScript to display and filterable the data by date, locations and shapes.

## Results
The webpage turned out pretty interactive. The user can search the UFO sighting by Date, City, State, Country and Shape that has been recorded in the data. Also there is no button to click to refresh the page so the update will be automatically.

This webpage will be able to perform a single filter like below. The date format and spelling for other columns are specific so do not mistype.

Also this webpage is able to operate multiple filtering as well, see below image.

## Summary

Even though this webpage is well apealing and farely interactive, there a few modification that could be made to make it more user friendly.
* The filters are specific and mistyping want we want to filter will end up in a error.

If possible, I would like to add a pulldown list for shape filter, autocorrecting the format for the date, and suggestion pane for the city, state and country.

This will allow the users to use the webpage with less stress.
